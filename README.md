# ArkanoidFromScratch

Everything in this project is made from scratch (intersection and collision logic, polygons, etc.) except for gui and input methods (keyboard controls, drawing to the screen, etc.).

* This is the first time I tried using unit testing, so most of the tests had a bad coupling problem, and weren't built well in the first place. Ended up leaving them as they are since it became a problem close to the end of the project.
