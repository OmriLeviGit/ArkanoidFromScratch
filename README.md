# ArkanoidFromScratch

Everything in this project is made from scratch (intersecion and collision logic, polygons, etc) except for gui and input methods (keyboard controls, drawing to the screen, etc).

* First time i tried unit testing, so most of the tests had a bad coupling problem, and werent built well in the first place. Ended up leaving them as they are since it became a problem close to the end of the project.
